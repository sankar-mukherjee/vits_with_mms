data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ002-0007.wav|Neild gives some figures which well illustrate this.
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ002-0009.wav|On the 27th April, in the following year,
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ002-0012.wav|After that they fell as steadily,
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ002-0023.wav|On the female side matters were much worse;

data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ002-0029.wav|as it was occupied and appropriated in 1810.
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ002-0032.wav|These were: 1. The male debtors' side.

data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ002-0076.wav|The state side contained twelve good-sized rooms,
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ002-0083.wav|The ground floor cells were nine feet by six;
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ002-0114.wav|and imprisonment for debt has almost entirely disappeared.
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ002-0116.wav|The number of processes against debtors annually was extraordinary.
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ002-0119.wav|In that period upwards of 200,000 writs
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ002-0125.wav|Neild also says that in 1793,
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ002-0129.wav|would have amounted to £68,728, and if defended,
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ002-0131.wav|three times the amount would be expended.
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ002-0136.wav|and the disuse of the inferior courts.
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ002-0139.wav|under 40 shillings arising within the city.
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ002-0142.wav|These courts were open to many and grave objections.
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ002-0151.wav|Neild found at his visit to Newgate in 1810,
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ002-0153.wav|weighted by treble the amount of costs.
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ002-0155.wav|for which the costs were 6 shillings 10 pence.
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ002-0191.wav|Besides those actually resident within the walls,

data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ002-0239.wav|also for prisoners committed by the Admiralty Court.
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ002-0250.wav|Their conduct too was orderly on the whole.

data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ003-0004.wav|No remonstrance was attended to,
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ003-0017.wav|Order throughout the debtors' side was preserved
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ003-0022.wav|This steward was practically supreme.

data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ004-0194.wav|No irons were worn except as a punishment.
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ004-0205.wav|Industrial labor had also been introduced with satisfactory results.
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ004-0206.wav|Blanket weaving and cloth spinning was carried on prosperously,
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ004-0208.wav|There were work-rooms for wool-washing, dyeing, carding, and spinning.

data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ005-0053.wav|A very valuable volume published by the Society
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ005-0057.wav|was introduced as early as 1790 by Mr. Blackburn

data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ005-0104.wav|The progress of improvement was certainly extremely slow.

data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ005-0195.wav|There was no decency whatever in the internal arrangements;
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ005-0207.wav|Kidderminster had a prison, one damp chill room,

data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ005-0247.wav|Mr. Samuel Hoare was examined by this committee
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ005-0261.wav|As a means of securing this uniformity,

data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ005-0280.wav|The Lords' Committee fully recognized the painful fact

data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ005-0288.wav|when speaking more particularly of the borough jails.
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ005-0297.wav|They therefore recommended that the prisoners should be removed
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ006-0009.wav|backed up by the evidence of several influential witnesses.

data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ006-0066.wav|In the middle yard it was still worse.
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ006-0081.wav|The wardsman still exacted dues, of which more directly,

data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ012-0120.wav|one of them of considerable size.
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ012-0138.wav|They also ascertained that a gold-refiner,

data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ012-0243.wav|There were many features of resemblance in these crimes.

data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ012-0280.wav|or of Gardelle's frantic efforts to conceal his crime.
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ012-0282.wav|This, wrapped up in a silk handkerchief,
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ012-0294.wav|without hesitation brought in a verdict of willful murder.
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ013-0002.wav|As the century advanced crimes of fraud increased.
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ013-0008.wav|came to light in this same year, 1841.

data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ013-0023.wav|that he got a chance of accomplishing his crime.
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ013-0031.wav|The crime soon became public.

data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ013-0060.wav|In the first a maiden lady, Miss Slack,

data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ013-0064.wav|Barber, it was said, became aware of this,

data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ013-0095.wav|Burgess' continued absence was soon noticed at the bank.
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ013-0097.wav|as soon as that gentleman was referred to.
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ013-0099.wav|A smart detective, Forrester, after a little inquiry,

data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ013-0148.wav|four thousand pounds
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ013-0154.wav|and the murderers immured within its walls.
data/ljspeech_filter/wavs/LJ013-0172.wav|were found in the butler's pantry, used by Courvoisier.
